This repo showcases some examples of testing code in iOS. 

- For Objective-C, check out [objc.md](https://github.com/nicnocquee/practical-ios-testing/blob/master/objc.md) and the accompanying sample project in `objc` folder. You will need to run `pod install` to install the dependencies.
- For Swift, not yet implemented. Contribution appreciated.
